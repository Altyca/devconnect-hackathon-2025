# MAGIC # Data Preparation
# MAGIC Effectively preparing your data is a foundational step in the forecasting process. Proper preparation ensures the accuracy and reliability of your model's predictions. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Data preparation steps can include:
# MAGIC - Missing Values: Identify and address missing values in your data. Common strategies include deletion (if minimal), imputation (filling in missing values with statistical methods or previous observations), or interpolation (estimating missing values based on surrounding data points).
# MAGIC - Outliers: Identify and handle outliers, which are extreme data points that can significantly distort your forecasts. You can choose to remove outliers if they are truly erroneous or winsorize them (capping their values to a certain threshold).
# MAGIC - Time Consistency: Ensure your data has consistent timestamps and that the time steps are evenly spaced (e.g., daily data points should be recorded at the same time each day).
# MAGIC Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing ones if it can improve the forecasting model's performance. This might involve calculating rolling averages, seasonality indicators, or lag features (past values of the target variable).

# COMMAND ----------

# Filtering out outliers
no_outliers_df = cleaned_df.filter(
    (col("sales") > lit(lower_bound)) 
    & (col("sales") <= lit(upper_bound)) 
)

# MAGIC # Model Selection
# MAGIC The model you choose will depend on the nature of your data and the specific forecasting problem you’re trying to solve. Take into consideration different data characteristics such as Frequency (daily vs weekly), granularity (hourly vs daily sales), seasonality, and any other external factors such as holidays, promotions etc. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Machine learning methods:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Prophet: User-friendly and specifically designed for time series forecasting, offering built-in seasonality and holiday handling.
# MAGIC - ARIMA: A classical statistical method for time series forecasting, capturing short-term patterns and trends in stationary data through autocorrelation, differencing, and moving average components.
# MAGIC - LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory): Powerful for capturing complex relationships and long-term dependencies in time series data.
# MAGIC For the scope of this tutorial, Prophet will serve as our primary model. Prophet stands out for its user-friendly nature and robust handling of various time series forecasting challenges, making it a versatile option for a wide range of applications.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC # Fit Data and Build Forecast
# MAGIC After fitting the model, you will create a DataFrame that outlines the future dates you wish to predict. Using this DataFrame, Prophet will generate forecasts for the specified future dates.

forecast_pd = prophet_model.predict(future_pd)

# COMMAND ----------

# TODO: build your own forecast

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC # Evaluation
# MAGIC This can be done by comparing the model’s forecasts to actual data and calculating performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE). Performance Metrics:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value, offering a view of the overall variance in the forecasting errors. Lower MSE values denote a model with fewer errors.
# MAGIC - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Represents the square root of MSE, thus re-scaling errors to the original units of the target variable, which improves interpretability.
# MAGIC - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Averages the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. Unlike MSE, MAE is more robust to outliers, as it does not square the errors.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Interpreting the Metrics
# MAGIC
# MAGIC MSE and RMSE are more sensitive to outliers due to squaring the errors, often used when large errors are particularly undesirable.
# MAGIC MAE is straightforward and easy to interpret, as it directly represents the average error.

# MAGIC # Log the model with MLflow
# MAGIC Model Logging is critical for tracking the performance and changes to models over time, ensuring reproducibility and accountability. Techniques include:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - MLflow Logging: Utilize MLflow's robust platform for logging models, parameters, and artifacts. It supports structured experiment tracking, perfect for recording and comparing different versions of your models.
# MAGIC - Custom Logging: Implement tailored logging approaches to capture unique model insights or additional metadata not standardly logged by existing tools.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Benefits of Logging with MLflow
# MAGIC Logging models with MLflow offers several advantages:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Reproducibility: By capturing all necessary details of the experimentation phase, MLflow makes it easier to replicate results and understand decision-making processes.
# MAGIC - Model Registry: MLflow allows for versioning of models, making it simple to manage and deploy specific model versions based on performance metrics.
# MAGIC - Collaboration and Sharing: Teams can leverage MLflow’s centralized model storage to share models and results, enhancing collaboration.
# MAGIC For the purpose of this tutorial, we demonstrate how to efficiently log a Prophet model using MLflow, capturing essential information that supports further analysis and model deployment.

# MAGIC # Deploy Models on Databricks
# MAGIC Deploying machine learning models into production on Databricks can be achieved through two primary methods: MLflow for batch inference and prediction, and Databricks Model Serving for real-time inference. Each serves different use cases based on the requirement for real-time responses and the scale of data processing.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - MLflow for Batch Inference and Prediction: Batch processing is ideal for scenarios where predictions can be made on large datasets at once without the need for immediate responses. This method fits well with scheduled analytics and reporting.
# MAGIC - Databricks Model Serving for Real-Time Inference: This method is better suited for scenarios where low latency and real-time responses are important.
